- 👋 Hi, I’m Ishay Shaer. I've been a concert pianist for almost 20 years and I started learning how to code in October 2023.
- 👀 Right now, my goal is to become a full-stack web developer with emphasis on the back-end. However, I haven't started back-end yet so it might change.
- 💞️ I’m eager to contribute to any interesting project I can help with and am open to suggestions!
- 📫 You can email me at ishayshaer@walla.co.il
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm still a pianist too!
